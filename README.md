Old and overly complex program to solve a simple problem on Windows XP: The Autorun Malware you get from USB Sticks

##### This is an abandoned project, released under the GNU GPLv2 License

This is an old application i made back in 2010 with VB.Net, after the last of countless times my Windows XP got infected with a new "Autorun malware".
Those malwares used to infect my friends' USB sticks and when i connected them to my PC the autorun made the new malware install and it always took a day of scans to fix the issue.
I wanted to have my PC safe but also not give up the comfort of having an action automatically performed at the connection of an USB drive.
That's how NAM came out, an DES3-Encrypted Autorun system that had the task to replace the standard autorun, allowing multiple programs to be run at once, as well as special actions to be performed.
It also featured logging, and a small "dropbox" that you could use to move small files directly in the last USB drive inserted.

This application uses CloudToolkit.net for the button design.
